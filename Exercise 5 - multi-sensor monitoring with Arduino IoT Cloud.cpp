// INSTRUCTIONS
// Exercise 5 builds on Exercise 4.
// In Exercise 5, using your DHT11 or LM35 sensors, read and display on your cloud dashboard temperature and humidity readings, once every 5 seconds.
// And then, add a water level sensor and display its reading on another display widget.  For this sensor, display the height of the water from the bottom edge of the sensor.
// Programming requirement:  You must poll the sensors in round robin fashion, displaying the temperature and humidity readings every 5 seconds and water level reading every 8 seconds.  Hint:  Use a loop.
// Submit a short video of your dashboard showing the temperature, humidity and water level display gauge widgets change values.  Submit also a copy of your code in a text file.  Write your name in the code as an inline comment.
